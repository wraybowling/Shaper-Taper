Print Shaper Origin compatible dominoes with your browser. [link](https://wraybowling.github.io/Shaper-Taper/)

## Features

- _psuedo-randomized combinations based on the name of the project_ You can reproduce the exact same sheet again to make another. The Origin should recognize these fudicials as if it was the same sheet you printed the first time.

## Future Ideas

- _maximized formations_ since this isn't tape anymore, why not scramble as many fudicials as possible into a given area in every orientation? Especially near the edges. I don't know. It's an idea.
