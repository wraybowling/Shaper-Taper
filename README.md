Work in Progress

## Features
- *psuedo-randomized combinations based on the name of the project* You can reproduce the exact same sheet again to make another. The Origin should recognize these fudicials as if it was the same piece of material


## In Progress
- *adjustable spacing* 
- *maximized formations* since this isn't tape anymore, why not scramble as many fudicials as possible into a given area in every orientation? Especially near the edges. I don't know. It's an idea.
